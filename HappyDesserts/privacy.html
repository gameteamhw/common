            We use ad identifiers that are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android and/or Apple’s ID for advertising associated with your device, and similar technologies such as tracking pixels within ads to provide interest-based advertising. These technologies enable us and our third-party advertising partners to recognize you and your device, allow our Services to interact with a third-party social network or platform and help our payment processors to work out your payment instructions. <br/>
